# Task 7: Real-Time Weather Dashboard Using an API

> **Level**: Level 3  
> **Requirements Met**: ✅ Fetches Live Data | ✅ Multiple Cities | ✅ Search Functionality | ✅ Loading States | ✅ Weather Icons | ✅ Clean Minimal UI  

## 🔍 Description

A minimalist, real-time weather dashboard that fetches live data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**. Designed with a clean, distraction-free interface, this project demonstrates advanced JavaScript skills including asynchronous operations, DOM manipulation, error handling, and dynamic rendering — key competencies for Level 3.

Features:
- Displays current temperature, condition, and 3-day forecast for up to 3 cities
- Search input to add new locations (e.g., Paris, Tokyo, New York)
- Weather icons dynamically loaded from OpenWeatherMap’s icon set
- Loading spinner while fetching data
- Error message displayed if city is not found
- Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop

## 🖥️ Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| ✅ **API Integration** | Uses `fetch()` to call OpenWeatherMap’s public endpoint (`/weather?q={city}`) |
| ✅ **Asynchronous Operations** | Async/await pattern for clean promise handling |
| ✅ **Dynamic Rendering** | New weather cards added to DOM on successful search |
| ✅ **Loading & Error States** | User feedback during network requests and failures |
| ✅ **UI Clarity** | Minimalist layout with large typography, clear spacing, and visual hierarchy |
| ✅ **Mobile First** | Single-column layout on small screens, touch-friendly inputs |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| HTML5 | Structure for cards and form elements |
| CSS3 | Styling, flexbox, animations, responsive breakpoints |
| JavaScript | Core logic: API calls, DOM updates, event listeners |
